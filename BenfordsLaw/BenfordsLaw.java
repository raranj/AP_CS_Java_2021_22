/**
 * Benford's law, or the first-digit law, is an observation about the frequency
 * distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The law states
 * that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading digit is likely to
 * be small. For example, in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading
 * significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant
 * digit less than 5% of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would
 * each occur about 11.1% of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the
 * distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.
 * 
 * Write a program that tests Benfordâ€™s Law. You will use data from two different real-life 
 * data sources. The data is stored in two separate text files: sunspots.txt and librarybooks.txt
 * Feel free to try this program out on other large sets of data!
 * 
 * You will loop through the list of numbers and count how many times 1 is the first
 * digit, 2 is the first, etc...
 * 
 * Your output/results should look like this:
 * 
 * Analysis of sunspot data:
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 1: 28.24%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 2: 12.04%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 3: 9.99%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 4: 10.34%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 5: 9.92%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 6: 8.36%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 7: 6.28%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 8: 6.38%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 9: 5.63%
 * 
 * Analysis of library book data:
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 1: 33.44%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 2: 17.57%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 3: 11.14%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 4: 8.77%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 5: 7.00%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 6: 6.13%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 7: 5.49%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 8: 5.50%
 * Percentage of numbers starting with 9: 4.95%
