/**
 * Which is more likely: at least one 6 in 6 rolls of a fair die,
 * or at least two 6's in 12 rolls of a fair die?
 * 
 * Write a program that runs a simulation to estimate these probabilities.
 * 
 * from Wikipedia:
 * The Newton–Pepys problem is a probability problem concerning the probability of 
 * throwing sixes from a certain number of dice. In 1693 Samuel Pepys and Isaac Newton
 * corresponded over a problem posed by Pepys (pronunced "peeps") in relation to a wager
 * he planned to make. The problem was:
 * Which of the following three propositions has the greatest chance of success?
 * 
 * A. Six fair dice are tossed independently and at least one “6” appears.
 * B. Twelve fair dice are tossed independently and at least two “6”s appear.
 * C. Eighteen fair dice are tossed independently and at least three “6”s appear.
 * 
 * Pepys initially thought that outcome C had the highest probability, but Newton
 * correctly concluded that outcome A actually has the highest probability.
